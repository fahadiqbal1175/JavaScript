# JavaScript DOM Projects

Welcome to my JavaScript repository! This collection contains a series of mini-projects designed to practice and demonstrate **DOM (Document Object Model)** manipulation using vanilla JavaScript.

Each project focuses on specific concepts such as event handling, intervals, random number generation, and dynamic styling.

## 📂 Project List

### 1. Color Scheme Switcher
**Folder:** `Project_1 color changer`  
A simple interactive page that allows users to change the background color of the body by clicking on color buttons.
- **Key Features:** `click` event listeners, style manipulation (`body.style.backgroundColor`).

### 2. BMI Calculator
**Folder:** `Project_2 BMI calculator`  
A tool that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for height (cm) and weight (kg). It also provides a weight status guide (Underweight, Normal, Overweight).
- **Key Features:** Form handling (`submit` event), value validation (`isNaN`), DOM insertion (`innerHTML`).

### 3. Digital Clock
**Folder:** `Project_3 Digital Clock`  
A real-time digital clock that displays the current local time and date.
- **Key Features:** `setInterval`, `Date` object methods (`toLocaleTimeString`, `toLocaleDateString`).

### 4. Guess the Number Game
**Folder:** `Project_4 Guess the number`  
A logic-based game where the user has 10 attempts to guess a random number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback ("Too low" or "Too high") and tracks previous guesses.
- **Key Features:** Logic flow, conditional statements, array manipulation (storing guesses), disabling/enabling form elements.

### 5. Keyboard Check
**Folder:** `Project_5 keyboard`  
A utility for developers that detects keyboard presses and displays key information instantly.
- **Key Features:** `keydown` event listener, dynamic table generation, displaying `e.key`, `e.keyCode`, and `e.code`.

### 6. Unlimited Colors
**Folder:** `Project_6 unlimited colors`  
An async/interval-based project where clicking "Start" changes the background color to a random Hex color every second, and "Stop" halts the process.
- **Key Features:** Random Hex code generation, `setInterval`, `clearInterval`.
